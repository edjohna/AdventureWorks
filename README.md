# Adventure Works' Acquisition of Biketastic: 
### Data Cleaning with Alteryx Designer and Creating a Dashboard with Power BI

As part of my participation in PwC's Data Analytics Academy, I was given the task of creating a Power BI dashboard to compare the sales figures of Adventure Works and Biketastic and determine the potential benefits of Adventure Works acquiring Biketastic.

To accomplish this, I utilized a dataset from Adventure Works, a fictitious outdoor retailer. The dataset contained sales information such as sales order numbers, unit price, order quantity, and more. The dataset was prepared and cleaned using Alteryx Designer. During the cleaning process, I used the "Data Cleansing" function under the Preparation tab to remove leading and trailing whitespaces from each cell and replace null values with blanks for string fields. Additionally, I employed the "Auto Field" feature to modify the field types of certain columns. For example, columns like SalesOrderNumber and CountryRegionCode were converted to strings, while columns like ProductKey and CustomerKey were converted to integers. Similar cleaning and preparation steps were applied to Biketastic's sales figure datasets.

To access the Alteryx Designer workflow, you can download the AW_Europe_Sales_Figures.yxmd file from the repository and open it using the Alteryx Designer desktop application on your computer.

To access the Power BI Dashboard, you can download the .pbix file from the repository and open it on your desktop. Alternatively, you can view the PDF file named "AdventureWorks_Sales_Europe.pdf."

On Slide 4 of the dashboard, you will find line charts comparing the profit over time of both companies, along with an analysis of how Adventure Works can benefit from acquiring Biketastic.

Slide 5 serves as a conclusion slide, summarizing the main advantages of Adventure Works acquiring Biketastic.
